    * statistical inference, model-based machine learning
    * high-performance computing
    * solving the hardest problems I can find in compelling & innovative ways
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
    * low-rank methods (e.g. robust PCA, compressed sensing)
    * Julia & Rust languages (as alternatives to Python/Cython)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
    * Advanced algorighms for genomic copy number inference (germline, somatic, NIPT, etc.)
- 📫 How to reach me
